Controling the number of output tokens in an LLM response is crucial for managing costs and ensuring the response is concise. Here are some strategies to control output tokens:

1. **Set a Maximum Token Limit**: Most LLM APIs allow you to specify a maximum number of tokens for the response. This is the simplest way to control output length.

2. **Use Prompt Engineering**: Design your prompts to elicit shorter responses. For example, instead of asking for a detailed explanation, you can ask for a summary or a specific piece of information.

3. **Specify Response Format**: If the LLM supports it, you can specify the format of the response (e.g., bullet points, short answers) to encourage brevity.

4. **Iterative Refinement**: If the initial response is too long, you can refine your prompt based on the output to ask for a more concise version.

Here are some examples of the above strategies:
